# Compiler-Construction-Lab
The Compiler-Construction-Lab, taught by Mr. Laeeq, guides students through building a compiler. It covers lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, intermediate code generation, optimization, and target code generation. The lab provides hands-on experience in each phase, reinforcing theoretical concepts with practical implementation.
